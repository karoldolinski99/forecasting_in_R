# forecasting_in_R

The aim of the project is to use various methods to forecast the values of a time series, and then compare them in the context of the quality of the forecasts obtained on both the training and test sets. The work begins with the analysis of a selected time series along with its decomposition using the STL method. Then, naive, ETS and Holt-Winters methods is implemented along with forecasts. The next stage of the work is the estimation of the ARIMA model, neural networks and the Theta method. The final chapter is a summary and comparison of all the methods used.
